  The discussion topic will be training. We will bring pens and paper so we can collect ideas and views.

  If you have a different burning issue you want to discuss feel free to include that as well.

  If you want to ask question I will also bring some post-its. A post-it with an Q (q is for question) on it is someone asking for help and a post-it with a A (a is for answer) on it is someone offering help.
