  &quot;Coding Club is a space in the week for researchers and students who want to set aside some time for learning new techniques, doing some socially useful coding, or just getting some eyes on a tricky problem.&quot;

  <h3>Python Club</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
  Python Club is a weekly meeting during term time concentrating on Python programming. Meetings are usually short talks on various aspects of Python, but also discussions around specific issues people are having, including teaching Python. It's run by Maths, but is of interest to anyone coding in Python.
