  The first meeting of the fledgling Leeds RSE network was held on Monday 12th December 2016.

  <div class="row">
  Over 50 developers, academics, researchers, support staff and IT professionals attended and began to define what the network should look like and do.

  <div class="row">
    The meeting started with a <a href="https://github.com/rseleeds/rseleeds.github.io/blob/master/assets/pdf/LengRSELeedsFirstMeeting2016_12_12_1.pdf">presentation by Dr. Joanna Leng</a> from the Advanced Research Computing service. After setting the scene Jo posed four questions:
    <ol>
    <li>What do we want from the network?</li>
    <li>How well is the adoption of computer aided research going? - at Leeds and elsewhere?</li>
    <li>What methodologies do we use? And is this different to computing methodologies that are not used for research?</li>
    <li>What makes an ideal career?</li>
    </ol>
    Small, rotating group discussions produced the following responses:
