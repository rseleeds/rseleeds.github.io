<p>
The first meeting of the fledgling Leeds RSE network was held on Monday 12th December 2016.
</p>
<p>
Over 50 developers, academics, researchers, support staff and IT professionals
attended and began to define what the network should look like and do.
</p>
<p>
The meeting started with a [presentation by Dr. Joanna Leng](https://github.com/rseleeds/rseleeds.github.io/blob/master/assets/pdf/LengRSELeedsFirstMeeting2016_12_12_1.pdf "Download slides") from the Advanced Research Computing service. After setting the scene Jo posed four questions:

1. What do we want from the network?
2. How well is the adoption of computer aided research going? - at Leeds and elsewhere?
3. What methodologies do we use? And is this different to computing methodologies that are not used for research?
4. What makes an ideal career?

Small, rotating group discussions produced the following responses:
