      Our first meeting in 2017 will be held in the Balcony Cafe, above the Refectory in the Students' Union building. 
      </div>
      <div class="row">
      The discussion topic will be training. We will bring pens and paper so we can collect ideas and views.

      <div class="row">
      If you have a different burning issue you want to discuss feel free to include that as well.

      <div class="row">
      We'd also like to help to connect people who may need help on a specific topic with others who may be able to help them. If you would like to ask a question Post-It notes will be available. We'll add any Post-It questions to this website so that possible helpers can help you to find the answer you're looking for.
      </div>
      <div class="row">
      Alternatively if you would like to make your skills or expertise in a certain area available to others, we'll provide Post-It notes for you to advertise this, too.
      </div>
      <div class="row">
      We look forward to seeing you at the meeting!
